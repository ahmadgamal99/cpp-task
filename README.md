## C++ Task

### Projects

- C++ Aggregator
- NodeJs Binance websocket server
- NodeJs Bitstamp websocket server

## Note
I have made ( NodeJs Binance websocket server & NodeJs Bitstamp websocket server) because I couldn't make openssl works with c++ because of incompatibility with library versions ( but iam working on it now after I finished the "main requirements of the task")
after I solve this issue inshallah the only change in the c++ app will be the 2 variables in the main function binanceUri & bitstampUri
